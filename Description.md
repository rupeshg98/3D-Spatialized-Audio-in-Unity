# COMP-590-A8

In this assignment, I made a maze with a lot of walls and I placed tiny, sound-making collectibles in hard-to-see spots so that the only 
way to reach them is by hearing the sounds they make. The objective is to use this 3D spatialized audtio to locate these objects and 
collect them.
