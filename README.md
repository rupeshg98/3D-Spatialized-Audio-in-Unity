I made a maze in the Unity game engine with a lot of walls and I placed tiny, sound-making collectibles in hard-to-see spots so that the only way to reach them is by hearing the sounds they make. The objective is to use this 3D spatialized audio to collect these objects to find the ideal path. Video of demo is attached.
